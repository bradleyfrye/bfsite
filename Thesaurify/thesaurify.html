				<h3>How to use Thesaurify</h3>
				<p><b>Step 1 - </b>Enter a sentence in the text box, by the phrase "Enter your sentence:".  Click Submit when you are finished.</p>
				<p><b>Step 2 - </b>Your sentence is analyzed (this may take a few seconds), and your words are added to the "Analysis" section.
					If the word doesn't have any synonyms, it will be colored gray, and cannot be interacted with.  Otherwise, it will have the
					color corresponding to a part of speech.  The initial part of speech is arbitrary, so it may be incorrect - you can change
					this by clicking on the word, and selecting the correct type of word from the dropdown.  Doing this helps make the final product
					make more sense.</p>
				<p>You can also check the box next to the lock: &#x1f512; icon, which will keep the word in its original form in the final result.</p>
				<p><b>Step 3 - </b>Click the Thesaurify button to create a new sentence with random synonyms of your words, according to the assigned
					parts of speech from Step 2.  Clicking the button again will generate new random synonyms.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
				<p>- The program will only be able to find synonyms of the <b>root</b> of a word, also known as the lemma, and will not find anything
				if given conjugated or plural forms; e.g., "drink" will get synonyms, but "drinks" or "drank" will not.</p>
				<p>- Certain words may be given strange synonyms based on abbreviations or other substitutions, due to the thesaurus service used.  For
				example, an earlier version of this program would replace the word "I" with "One" or "Iodine".  I've since adding special handling for
				common words like this, but there are likely other words that will still be treated as abbreviations.</p>
				<p>- Thesaurus lookup service is provided by <b>thesaurus.altervista.org</b>.</p>
