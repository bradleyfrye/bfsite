                    <h3>What does this program do?</h3>
                    <p>This program is just a simple online list of items, organized by groups of people
                    into houses. Users on this website can log in, and open a house that they're a member
                    of, where they can view the list and add/remove items from it.</p>

                    <h4>How to use:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 0:</strong> You need to create a user and log in to use this program.
                    Creating a user on this site is easy, immediate, and secure - click <a href="/Register">here</a>
                    to register and click <a href="/Login">here</a> to log in.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visiting this page as a logged in user, you'll see house icons showing
                    any houses you're a member of, a link to join a house, and a link to create a house. Click the
                    <a href="/List/houseCreate">create link</a> if you'd like to make a new list for a group of people 
                    (or just for yourself.) On the create page, just specify a name and click Submit, and the
                    house is made.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you'd like to add yourself to a house someone else created, click
                    the <a href="/List/houseSearch">join link</a>. Enter the name of the house you'd like to join (case
                    doesn't matter), click submit, and you'll be added to the house.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To view a list, click on the corresponding house icon on the main page.
                    From here, you can add items by entering a quantity and item description, and click Add Item or press
                    Enter.  You can remove items from the list by clicking the X button in the right column.
